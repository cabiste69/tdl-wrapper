# Introduction

this app is a wrapper tool for [tdl](<https://github.com/iyear/tdl>) that aims to make it easy for non nerdy people to bulk download media from telegram (requires telegram account)

# How to use

just download the version that corresponds to your system from [here](<https://github.com/cabiste69/tdl-wrapper/releases/latest>) and launch the app

# compiling

This app uses [.Net 8](<https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0>) for building

and for publishing the executables it uses [bflat](<https://github.com/bflattened/bflat>)

for convenance there's a bat file for auto compiling all the executables (windows / linux / mac) under the `tools/` folder (requires bflat to be in path)
